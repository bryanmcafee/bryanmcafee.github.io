Since this is my first Blog post I figured I would start by introducing myself before I explain how and why I decided to make a career change at this stage in my life.  

So, as you have guessed from the title my name is Bryan McAfee, I am 40 something, I quit counting when I hit 38.  I am the proud single dad of my 8-year-old daughter Cristina.  I am also an Army vet, I served from 1991 to 1997.  During my time in the military I worked with the Patriot Missile system and did 3 “combat” deployments, although they were more like 6 month vacations in another country.  I got out of the Army in 1997 and had no clue what I wanted to do and decided on a whim to move into the I.T. field since I liked to play video games.  No clue how I connected those two.

My first few jobs in I.T. were more data entry than anything but it did let me get a lot of supervised hands on experience.   During the next 20 years I developed my skills and learned I really enjoyed working and teaching my fellow employees.  One of the things I enjoyed the most was finding ways to make life easier on the people I worked with thru technology, this was probably the first indication that coding may have been a better choice for me although I did not realize it at the time.  

The issue I would always run into when trying to streamline processes for the various companies I worked for was the software we used was just to cookie cutter and could not be easily modified to do what was needed.  If it could be then it would to be custom coded and it costed an arm and a leg for even small changes.   This was the start of my adventures in coding as I would attempt and normally fail to make some of the changes on my own.  About this time I even got the owner of the company I worked for to agree to pay for me to go back to school and learn to code.  Little did I know I was about to be thrown the biggest curve ball of my life, I found out I was going to be the father of a little baby girl.

I will not get to much into the circumstances around my daughter but it ended up that I would be responsible for bringing her up on my own.  I made the decision to open my own computer consulting company so I would have a schedule that allowed me to raise my daughter and school was put on indefinite hold. As she had grown and now at old enough where me and her could talk about work and she could understand I decided to look back into learning to code.  

I started with college but in part to a article that Mike Rowe, from the TV show Dirty Jobs had written I started looking for a tech school.   Since I was a Veteran I was looking for a school that might offer financial help with tuition since I am pretty much living pay check to pay check.  I ran across Flatiron and the Hire Hero’s program.   I applied for the full scholarship with zero expectancy of getting it.  I did start up the boot camp prep for Flatiron and loved it.  I was planning on signing up for $149.00 a month plan and to push thru that way since there really was no finical aid for tech schools available.  About 3 days before I was ready to pay and get started I received an e-mail   that said I had won the Hire Hero’s scholarship.  Other than my daughter being born I think this was one of the best days of my life.

That brings me up to now I am currently about 75% of the way thru the Intro to Ruby.  I am struggling to balance enough work to make ends meet and to try and study enough so that I can complete the course by this upcoming summer.  For me learning again has been great especially something that I really have a interest in.  The first lab that was hard for me one of the Tic Tac Toe ones I actually got up and danced when it passed.   My daughter has been very supportive of me and actually tells me to go study now and wants me to hurry up and make the Tic Tac Toe game work so she can play me.

To sum this up I can say its nice to actually be back on track learning to code so that I can be able to do something in a field I actually have a passion for , and I am excited to learn more each day.  I did also want to thank Flatiron and Hire Hero’s for this opportunity and the scholarship.
